# PowerShell
I've been gradually learning PowerShell over the past year in my current job role and joined GitHub as a way to publicly share my PowerShell code repository with the PowerShell community. There may be code or scripts within this repository which are not my own, nor do I claim to own them. Any scripts that are not my own should contain the original author in the comments.
